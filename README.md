Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Objective:

Understand the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns, 
trends, and feature relationships before applying machine learning. 

Tools & Libraries: 
1. Python 
2. Pandas 
3. Matplotlib 
4. Seaborn 
5. Plotly 

Steps: 
1. Summary Statistics: 
o View key stats like mean, median, and standard deviation using describe(). 
2. Visualize Numeric Features: 
o Use histograms to see distributions. 
o Use boxplots to detect outliers. 
3. Feature Relationships: 
o Use pairplot() for scatter plots between features. 
o Use a correlation matrix to detect linear relationships. 
4. Detect Patterns & Anomalies: 
o Identify skewed data, clusters, or outliers using visual tools. 
5. Basic Inferences: 
o Print mean, median, and standard deviation for each numeric column to summarize 
insights.

How to Run: 
1. Place the Titanic dataset in the same folder. 
2. Run the Python script.

Output: 
1. Printed summary statistics and missing values. 
2. Histograms and boxplots for each numeric feature. 
3. Pairwise feature plots and correlation heatmap. 
4. Interactive boxplots using Plotly. 
5. Printed basic stats for feature-level inference.
