Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)    
Objective: 
Understand the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns, 
trends, and feature relationships before applying machine learning. 
Tools & Libraries: 
 Python 
 Pandas 
 Matplotlib 
 Seaborn 
 Plotly 
Steps: 
1. Summary Statistics: 
o View key stats like mean, median, and standard deviation using describe(). 
2. Visualize Numeric Features: 
o Use histograms to see distributions. 
o Use boxplots to detect outliers. 
3. Feature Relationships: 
o Use pairplot() for scatter plots between features. 
o Use a correlation matrix to detect linear relationships. 
4. Detect Patterns & Anomalies: 
o Identify skewed data, clusters, or outliers using visual tools. 
5. Basic Inferences: 
o Print mean, median, and standard deviation for each numeric column to summarize 
insights. 
How to Run: 
1. Place the Titanic dataset in the same folder. 
2. Run the Python script. 
Output: 
 Printed summary statistics and missing values. 
 Histograms and boxplots for each numeric feature. 
 Pairwise feature plots and correlation heatmap. 
 Interactive boxplots using Plotly. 
 Printed basic stats for feature-level inference.
